Gujju Chat Bot

Many people avoid  visiting  healthcare  professionals  and  even  treatable diseases/ailments become life-threatening, contributing to the high mortality rates. The  solution  is  adopting  healthcare chatbots.The chatbot  application  that  analyses  the  userâ€™s symptoms through a  conversation with  the user and  maps these  symptoms  to  the  available  dataset.  The  system  can converse  with  the  user  via  text  or  speech.  The  user  can choose the language he wishes to communicate in. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is applied to the user input to determine the symptoms. They ensure  initial  assistance  over  one-on-one  conversations economically  and  on-demand.
